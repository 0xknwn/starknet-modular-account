# Using Multiple Signers

The starknet modular account not only can have multiple signers registered but
it can also require N of those signers to agree to sign a transaction. This
This Multisig feature takes place offchain and the `SmartrAccount` class
provides the framework to have several accounts sign the same transaction. This
is what is shown in this section.

## An Account with 3 Registered Keys

As seen in [Executing external functions in the module](./SDKS-SMARTRACCOUNT.md#executing-external-functions-in-the-module) from the previous section,
registering new keys with the account requires you create the call with the
Stark Validator ABI and the `CallData` class. Then we can call the
`execute_on_module` function from from the modular account to register the key.
The example below shows how to do it with a multiple call to the the `execute`
of the account:

```typescript
{{#include ../experiments/documentation-examples/src/03-add-publickeys.ts}}
```

Transpile and run the script:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-add-publickeys.js
```

You can re-run the script from the previous section to check the currently
registered public keys. We provide a copy of that script named
`03-registered-publickeys.ts` that you can run:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-registered-publickeys.js
```

The output should look like that:

```text
number of public keys for module 3
publickey # 1 0x1ef15c18599971b7beced415a40f0c7deacfd9b0d1819e03d723d8bc943cfca
publickey # 2 0x759ca09377679ecd535a81e83039658bf40959283187c654c5416f439403cf5
publickey # 3 0x411494b501a98abd8262b0da1351e17899a0c4ef23dd2f96fec5ba847310b20
```

## Changing the Account Threshold to 2

By changing the Stark Validator Threshold to 2, you force transactions to be
signed by 2 of the 3 signers of the account. Run a script like below to
change the threshold:

```typescript
{{#include ../experiments/documentation-examples/src/03-increase-threshold.ts}}
```

Transpile and run the script:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-increase-threshold.js
```

You can check the current threshold on the account with the script below:

```typescript
{{#include ../experiments/documentation-examples/src/03-get-threshold.ts}}
```

Run the script with the command below:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-get-threshold.js
```

## Checking you can **NOT** run a transaction with a single signer

The script below executes a transaction with a single signer as it was the case
in the previous section:

```typescript
{{#include ../experiments/documentation-examples/src/03-execute-tx.ts}}
```

Make sure you have deployed the account and the counter contract in the network
and run the following commands:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-execute-tx.js
```

You are now getting an error saying the signature is invalid like below:

```output
Execution failed.
Failure reason: 0x4163636f756e743a20696e76616c6964207369676e6174757265 
('Account: invalid signature')
```

## Running a Multiple Signer Transaction

To run a transaction with multiple signers, you need to instantiate several
`SmartrAccount`, each one with a different signer. Because you have set the
threshold, you need to instantiate 2 accounts.

Once done, proceed in 3 steps:

- Step 1: generate the transaction details. This requires you create the calls
  but also you set some details about it, including: the Fees, the Nonce, the
  Version and the Chain. The `SmartrAccount` class uses the provider to
  get the chain id. To get the other details, you should run the
  `prepareMultisig` that returns the details associated with the transaction.
- Step 2: have all the signers generate their part of the signature. The
  `signMultisig` takes the list of calls and the details you have generated and
  provides the signature as an array of string
- Step 3: Execute the transaction with all the signatures from Step 2. This
  could be done by anyone, including one of the account you have already
  created. The `executeMultisig` function takes the list of calls, the details
  and an array that contains all the signatures.

The script below signs the transaction with 2 signers and to run the `increment`
external function of the `Counter` contract. It shows the value of the counter
before and after the call:

```typescript
{{#include ../experiments/documentation-examples/src/03-execute-tx-multiple-signers.ts}}
```

Transpile and run the script:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-execute-tx-multiple-signers.js
```

## Reset the threshold to one

As for any transaction, you need to run a multi-signed transaction to reset the
account threshold back to one. The script below build the call to
`execute_on_module` and run it with multiple signer:

```typescript
{{#include ../experiments/documentation-examples/src/03-decrease-threshold.ts}}
```

Execute the script with the following commands:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-decrease-threshold.js
```

You can check the threshold is back to one:

```shell
node dist/03-get-threshold.js
```

## Remove Registered Keys

You can now run transaction with a single signer on the account. The script
below shows how to remove 2 public keys from a single call:

```typescript
{{#include ../experiments/documentation-examples/src/03-remove-publickeys.ts}}
```

Transpile and run the script:

```shell
npx tsc --build

node dist/03-remove-publickeys.js
```

You can check the 2 of the 3 public keys have been removed:

```shell
node dist/03-registered-publickeys.js
```
