Once we have a first version of our smart account that can embed module, this
is what could come next:

- Port the session key as an extension
- Check if there is a way to rely on a Manager/Registry/Module Interfaces
  like Safe does
- Develop Dapps starting with a bot able to perform a "Stop-Loss" Order
- Try to get a grants from Starknet or, at least, be involved in a Hackathon
- Build a Community on Discord
