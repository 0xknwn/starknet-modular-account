This document presents the tools and resources used to build the project. It
references what you should learn and what tools you should use.

## Learning

To learn, a good starting point is
- [starklings-cairo1](https://github.com/shramee/starklings-cairo1.git)

- [cairo book](https://book.cairo-lang.org/)
- [starknet developer portal](https://www.starknet.io/en/developers), the
- [starknet documentation](https://docs.starknet.io/documentation/) and the
- [starknet community portal](https://community.starknet.io/).

## Developing

There is no specific order to the presentation below. Feel free to add some
more resources and document them if needed:

- [starknet-devnet-rs](./resources/devnet-rs.md) is a rust version of the
  starknet devnet. It is not completed yet but can be used in a number of cases
- [katana](https://book.dojoengine.org/toolchain/katana/overview) is another
  rust version of a devnet and might also be used to run tests locally

- scarb

Also note that Starkware provides nice workshops and learning resources
including the [Abstract Account development](https://github.com/starknet-edu/aa-workshop)

## Other considerations

- To get ETH on Starknet Sepolia
  - there is a [Faucet on blast.io](https://blastapi.io/faucets/starknet-sepolia-eth)
  - the starknet book explains how to
    [bridge ETH with Starknet](https://book.starknet.io/ch02-05-01-start-with-sepolia.html)
